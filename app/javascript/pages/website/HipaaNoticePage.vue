              amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), to

              <b>Definition Of Protected Health Information</b>
            </p>

            <p class="p4">
              PHI is information about you, including your demographic information, that relates to your physical or
              mental health condition or health care provided to you. PHI can include your medical history, laboratory
              results, insurance information, and other health information that is collected, generated, used, and
              communicated by RENEGADE to produce genetic testing results and bill for our testing services. Examples of
              PHI include your name, date of birth, medical record number, social security number, insurance beneficiary
              number, and genetic information.

            <h4 class="h4">Uses and disclosures of your protected health information</h4>
            <p class="p4">RENEGADE may use or disclose your PHI for the following purposes:</p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li><em><b>Treatment.</b></em> We may use or disclose your PHI for purposes of providing your medical
                treatment. For example, we may use your PHI to perform our testing services and disclose your genetic
                testing results to your physician and other health care providers involved in your care. </li>
              <li><em><b>Payment.</b></em> We may use or disclose your PHI for purposes of billing and collecting payment
                for our services. For example, we may disclose PHI to your health plan in order to obtain payment for the
                services provided to you. </li>
              <li><em><b>Healthcare operations.</b></em> We may use or disclose your PHI to facilitate our healthcare
                operations. For example, we may review your PHI to monitor the quality and accuracy of our testing
                services and review the competence and qualifications of our laboratory professionals. </li>
              <li>
                <em><b>Persons involved in your care or payment for your care.</b></em> We may disclose your PHI to
                persons involved in your care or payment for your case, such as a family member, relative, or close
                friend, unless you object or ask us not to.
              </li>
              <li><em><b>Notification.</b></em> We may use or disclose your PHI to notify or assist in notifying a family
                member, personal representative, or another person responsible for your care regarding your location and
                general condition. </li>
              <li><em><b>Personal representatives.</b></em> We may disclose your PHI to your authorized personal
                representative, such as a lawyer, administrator, executor, or other authorized person responsible for you
                or your estate. </li>
              <li><em><b>Minors’ PHI.</b></em> We may disclose PHI about minors to their parents or legal guardians. </li>
              <li><em><b>Communication about products and services.</b></em> We may use and disclose your PHI to contact
                you about other RENEGADE products and services which we believe may be of interest to you. We do not
                disclose your PHI to third parties for marketing purposes without your written authorization. </li>
              <li><em><b>Sale of your information.</b></em> RENEGADE will never sell your PHI to third parties unless you
                provide written authorization.
              </li>
              <li><em><b>Disclosures to business associates.</b></em> We may disclose your PHI to other companies or
                individuals, known as “Business Associates,” who provide services to us. For example, we may use a company
                to perform billing services on our behalf. Our Business Associates are required to protect the privacy and
                security of your PHI and notify us of any improper disclosure of information. </li>
              <li><em><b>Fundraising.</b></em> We may use or disclose your PHI to our Business Associates to contact you
                regarding our fundraising activities. You have the right to opt out of receiving fundraising
                communications.
              </li>
              <li><em><b>As required by law.</b></em> We may use or disclose your PHI if required to do so by any
                applicable federal, state, or local law.
              </li>
              <li><em><b>Public health activities.</b></em> We may disclose your PHI for public health-related activities.
                Examples include reporting diseases to authorized public health authorities, public health investigations,
                or notifying a manufacturer of a product regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) of
                a possible problem encountered when using the product in our testing process. </li>
              <li><em><b>Health oversight activities.</b></em> We may disclose your PHI to a healthcare oversight agency
                for activities that are authorized by law, such as audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure
                activities. For example, we may disclose your PHI to agencies responsible for ensuring compliance with the
                rules of government health programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid. </li>
              <li><em><b>Research.</b></em> Under certain circumstances, we may use or disclose your PHI for research
                purposes within RENEGADE and with research collaborators outside of RENEGADE who are under contract and
                are also obligated to protect PHI. Generally, research projects at RENEGADE are subject to review by a
                committee responsible for ensuring the protection of individual research subjects, appropriate patient
                authorization, and an adequate plan to safeguard PHI. </li>
              <li><em><b>Judicial and administrative proceedings.</b></em> Under certain circumstances, we may disclose
                your PHI as required to comply with a judicial or administrative order or in response to a subpoena,
                discovery request, or other lawful process. </li>
              <li><em><b>Law enforcement.</b></em> We may disclose your PHI to the police or other law enforcement
                officials as required by law or in compliance with a court order, warrant, subpoena, summons, or other
                legal process for locating a suspect, fugitive, witness, missing person, or victim of a crime. </li>
              <li><em><b>Threats to health and safety.</b></em> We may disclose your PHI to prevent or reduce the risk of
                a serious and imminent threat to the health and safety of an individual or the general public. </li>
              <li><em><b>Victims of abuse, neglect, or violence. </b></em> . If required or authorized by law, we may
                disclose your PHI to a government agency, such as a social services or protective services agency, if we
                reasonably believe that an individual adult or child is the victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic
                violence. </li>
              <li><em><b>Data breach notification. </b></em> We may use your PHI to provide legally required notices of
                unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of your PHI. </li>
              <li><em><b>De-identification of PHI. </b></em> We may de-identify your PHI by removing identifying features
                as determined by law to make it extremely unlikely that the information could identify you.</li>
              <li><em><b>All other disclosures. </b></em> Uses and disclosures of PHI for purposes other than those
                described above (or as otherwise permitted or required by law) will not be made without a written
                authorization signed by you or your personal representative. Once you sign an authorization, you may
                revoke it at any time by contacting RENEGADE, unless we have already relied upon it to use or disclose
                PHI. A revocation of authorization must be submitted to the Privacy Officer at the address provided at the
                end of this Notice. </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="p4">
              <em><b>Additional uses and disclosures.</b></em> RENEGADE may also use or disclose your PHI in other ways as
              permitted by law, including, but not limited to or for:

            <h4 class="h4">Your Rights Regarding Your Medical Information</h4>
            <p class="p4">You have the following rights with respect to your PHI. To exercise any of these rights, please
              contact our Privacy Officer using the contact information provided at the end of this Notice.</p>

            <p class="p4">
              <em><b>Access to PHI and test results. </b> </em> You, or your authorized representative, have the right to
              inspect and copy your PHI maintained by us. You may retrieve your test results using an online patient
              portal or by requesting a copy of your information, in which case we may charge you a reasonable fee for the
              costs of copying, mailing, or other supplies that are necessary to fulfill your request. If we maintain an
              electronic health record containing your information, you have the right to request that we send a copy of
              your health information in electronic format to you or a third party that you identify. We may deny access
              to certain information for specific reasons, for example, if the access requested is reasonably likely to
              endanger the life or safety of you or another person. If your request for information is denied, you may
              request that the denial be reviewed by filing a request for review with RENEGADE’s Privacy Officer.
            </p>

            <p class="p4">
              <em><b>Restrictions on uses and disclosures. </b></em> You have the right to request restrictions on our
              uses and disclosures of your PHI. While we will consider all requests for additional restrictions carefully,
              we are not required to agree to a requested restriction except for restrictions on uses or disclosures for
              the purpose of carrying out payment or health care operations, where you have made payment to RENEGADE
              “out-of-pocket” and in full. If we do agree to a requested restriction, we will not disclose your PHI in
              accordance with the agreed-upon restriction.
            </p>

            <p class="p4">
              <em><b>Alternative confidential communications. </b></em> You may request that we communicate with you about
              your PHI in a specific means or to an alternative postal mail or email address. Your request must be in
              writing and must specify the alternative means or location. We will accommodate reasonable requests for
              confidential communications. We reserve the right to verify your identity in order to confirm the
              alternative contact and address information.
            </p>

            <p class="p4">
              <em><b>Correct or update your information. </b></em>If you believe the PHI we maintain about you contains an
              error, you may request that we correct or update your information. Your request must be in writing and must
              explain why the information should be corrected or updated. We may deny your request under certain
              circumstances and provide a written explanation.
            </p>

            <p class="p4">
              <em><b>Accounting of disclosures.</b></em>You may request a list, or accounting, of certain disclosures of
              your PHI made by RENEGADE in the past six years from the date of your request. Under the law, this does not
              include disclosures made for purposes other than treatment, payment, healthcare operations, and certain
              other activities. The accounting will exclude disclosures we have made directly to you, disclosures to
              friends or family members involved in your care, disclosures made pursuant to a valid authorization, and
              disclosures for notification purposes. The request must be in writing. The first accounting you request
              within a twelve (12) month period will be provided free of charge, but you may be charged for the cost of
              providing additional accountings. We will notify you of the cost involved, and you may choose to withdraw or
              modify your request at that time.

              been compromised. You will be notified in a timely manner, no later than sixty (60) days after discovery of
