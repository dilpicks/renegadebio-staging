          <p class="p4"><em><b>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</b></em> Our Sites use strictly necessary cookies. These
            cookies are necessary for our Sites to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually
            only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your
            privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about
            these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally

          <p class="p4"><em><b>Analytics Cookies: </b></em>The RENEGADE Site, the Provider Portal, and the Patient Portal
            use analytics cookies. These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and
            improve the performance of our Sites. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see
            how visitors move around the Sites. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore

            general usage statistics. In order for Google Analytics to function, when you use our Sites, Google will place

            cookies. Information collected by Google Analytics when you use our Sites, and the way it is used, is

          <p class="p4"><em><b>Advertising Cookies: </b></em>Certain portions of the RENEGADE Site use advertising

          </p>

          <p class="p4">
            <b>Authorized Agents.</b> You may use an authorized agent to submit a consumer rights request. When we verify
            your agent’s request, we may verify both your and your agent’s identity and request a signed document from you
            that authorizes your agent to make the request for you. To protect your personal information, we reserve the

            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, subject to your
            rights, in certain circumstances, to have your personal information erased. We may be required by law to hold
            certain personal information for specific periods. In other cases, we will retain your personal information
            for an appropriate period after our relationship ends to protect ourselves from legal claims or to administer
