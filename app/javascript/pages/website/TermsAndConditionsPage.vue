            provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Without limiting the
            generality of the preceding sentence, if any remedy set forth in these Terms is
            determined to have failed of its essential purpose, then all other provisions of these
            Terms, including the limitation of liability and exclusion of damages shall remain in
            full force and effect.

            To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, you agree to indemnify, defend, and

            subsidiaries, parent companies, and affiliates (the “Indemnitees”) from and against all

            or use, our Site; (2) your breach of these Terms, in each case unless caused by such
            Indemnitee’s misrepresentation, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud; or (3)
            your violation of Applicable Laws. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense
            and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event
            you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defense. You agree not to settle
            any matter without the prior written consent of RENEGADE. RENEGADE will use reasonable
            efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.
