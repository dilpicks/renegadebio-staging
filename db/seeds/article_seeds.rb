According to researchers, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3320">pregnant women with COVID-19</a> admitted to hospitals are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit or need invasive ventilation than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.</p><p class="p4">Additional research suggests they are also more likely to have a premature birth (earlier than 37 weeks), <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-section/about/pac-20393655#:~:text=Cesarean%20delivery%20(C%2Dsection),birth%20after%20cesarean%20(VBAC).">cesarean delivery</a> (C-section), and their babies are more likely to be <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3320">admitted to a neonatal unit</a>. There may also be an increased risk for other poor outcomes, such as pregnancy loss, when comparing pregnancy to people without COVID-19. Due to the increased risk of severe outcomes, the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html">CDC</a> (and Australian organizations RANZCOG and ATAGI) recommend COVID-19 vaccination for women at any stage of pregnancy.</p><h3 class="h3" id="covid-19-vaccines-and-fertility">COVID-19 Vaccines & Fertility</h3><h4 class="h4" id="how-do-the-covid-vaccines-work">How do the COVID vaccines work?</h4><p class="p4">If you&rsquo;re curious or want a refresher on how the new mRNA and DNA vaccines work?

Without vaccines, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html">America may still be a part of Britain</a> today. Since then, there have been a number of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html">types of vaccines</a> developed. The current methodology behind the available COVID-19 vaccines are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html">messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines</a> (Pfizer, Moderna) and viral vector vaccines (J&J). Viral vector vaccines have been previously utilized, but mRNA vaccines are a newer technology first employed for SARS-CoV-2. Though <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html">mRNA vaccines</a> are new, researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for decades.</p><h4 class="h4" id="debunking-the-covid-19-vaccines-fertility-myth">Debunking the COVID-19 Vaccines Fertility Myth</h4><p class="p4">Since the first vaccine, there&rsquo;s been an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/your-vaccination.html">anti-vaccination movement</a> right by its side. More recently, fake news articles circulated across the internet that claimed COVID-19 vaccines affect fertility.

Women involved were given pregnancy tests before they were accepted into the study, and were excluded if they were already pregnant. However, 23 women conceived during the trial. Twelve of these pregnancies happened in the vaccine group, and 11 in the placebo group.

MotherToBaby is a non-profit organization of teratology information specialists, who provide evidence-based information on the safety of medications and other exposures during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</p><p class="p4">Individuals who decide against vaccination are encouraged to monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19 and get tested periodically. If you come into close contact with someone who is infected with COVID-19, you must quarantine and watch for symptoms, even if you are fully vaccinated. The length of quarantine depends on numerous variables. Local public health authorities make the final decisions about how long quarantine should last, based on local conditions and needs.</p><h4 class="h4" id="does-the-covid-19-vaccine-affect-male-fertility">Does the COVID-19 Vaccine Affect Male Fertility?</h4><p class="p4">The Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines do not impact <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.urologytimes.com/view/study-shows-covid-19-vaccines-do-not-affect-male-fertility">male fertility</a>.

One study found that one-third of U.S. women want to put pregnancy on hold, or have fewer children.</p><p class="p4">The fact that women and infants are found to be at heightened risk may encourage individuals to avoid having children and increase the demand for abortion services. Although the American Public Health Association recognizes access to abortion as a fundamental right, we&rsquo;ve observed throughout the pandemic a number of states that put this right into question.</p><p class="p4">Anti-abortion government officials in several states enacted or attempted to enact restrictions on abortion.

In-person instruction supports academic and interpersonal development, while providing hands-on learning and fewer distractions (compared to online learning). According to a Gallup poll, nearly three in ten parents said their child has <q><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/20210608-impacts-of-covid19.pdf">experienced harm to their emotional or mental health</a>,</q> claiming that separation from teachers and classmates is the main cause.</p><p class="p4">On the other hand, studies show that <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html#covid-19-children-adolescents">children are more commonly asymptomatic</a>, and it&rsquo;s estimated that over 50% of COVID-19 cases are transmitted by people <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/asymptomatic-coronavirus-infections-contribute-to-over-50-percent-of-spread">without symptoms</a>. Even without symptoms, testing identifies infected people—making regular screenings an important strategy for teachers, staff, and students in areas of moderate to high transmission.</p><p class="p4">In-person learning is safe when accompanied by stringent protocols and continuous monitoring. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html#covid-19-children-adolescents">Case studies</a> have demonstrated that in-person learning is not associated with an increased spread of COVID-19 when community transmission is low. However, cases in schools did increase at moderate-to-high levels of community transmission rates.</p><p class="p4">Although the rate of severe outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, mortality) amongst K-12 age groups are lower, youth who belong to some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected.</p><p class="p4">For example, a higher proportion of COVID-19 cases amongst BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, (and) People of Color) children resulted in hospitalization than among White children. Therefore, school sponsored COVID-19 testing programs create equitable access that builds confidence within communities.</p><h3 class="h3" id="other-risks">Other Risks</h3><h4 class="h4" id="variants">Variants</h4><p class="p4">Viruses constantly mutate and variants are expected. To date, there are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/covid-variants">variants of concern</a> of COVID-19, some stronger and more transmissible than others. The first variant to raise expert alarm was Delta, and more recently Omicron.</p><p class="p4">COVID-19 variants increase danger, especially for at-risk populations. To slow the emergence of new variants, reducing the spread is critical, which will be far more difficult if animal populations are now an increased concern.</p><p class="p4"><em>To learn more about the COVID-19 variants, check out our blog article, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/covid-variants">What you need to know about new COVID variants</a></em>.</p><h4 class="h4" id="long-term-impacts">Long-term Impacts</h4><p class="p4">Most people who contract COVID-19 recover within weeks of illness, but some experience post-COVID conditions. As more people in the U.S. recover from COVID-19, researchers and physicians observed that some survivors, including children, experience prolonged after effects such as: long-lasting fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, lung problems, joint pain, brain fog and other symptoms.

      { content: '<div class="sub-section"><p class="p4">After a year of uncertainty and social disruption, states <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-a-state-by-state-guide-11611703769">have started rolling out their vaccination programs</a>. With President Joe Biden&rsquo;s <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/politics/biden-merck-johnson--johnson-vaccine/index.html">announcement that we will have enough vaccines for every adult by the end of May</a>, we have reason for hope while folks are waiting to be able to access the vaccine.</p><p class="p4">We are in a race between vaccination and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/covid-variants">variant mutations</a>. The longer it takes to get people vaccinated, the more likely <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/02/covid-19-vaccine-golden-rule/618140/">mutations will emerge, as the virus rages amongst communities</a>. Winning the race means vaccinating the overwhelming majority of the world population. So far, studies show that that the current vaccines are providing protection against the variants.</p><p class="p4">The good news is that every vaccination moves us closer as a nation to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19">herd immunity</a>. But in the meantime, we need to know how much it&rsquo;s safe to ease up on our precautionary behaviors. This blog post will help clarify what you can and can&rsquo;t do once you&rsquo;re fully vaccinated.</p><h3 class="h3">Getting the Vaccine</h3><p class="p4">Congrats, you&rsquo;ve made the wise choice to trust some of the best informed virologists and medical experts in the country, also known as the Centers for Disease Control! These vaccines are our best and most effective tool to fight COVID-19 and limit the spread of the virus and its <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/covid-variants">new variants</a>.</p><p class="p4">For most vaccines, full protection comes two weeks <em>after</em> receiving your second dose of the vaccine. (Be sure to follow the specific instructions for the vaccine you receive.) It takes this long for your body to build the necessary protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.</p><p class="p4">Because it&rsquo;s possible to become infected with the virus in the interim time between receiving the vaccine and building up immunity, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">you still need to practice prevention</a>.</p><p class="p4">Once vaccinated, it&rsquo;s still possible (though less likely) to catch the virus and potentially pass it to others. In the unlikely event that you are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, your symptoms will be greatly reduced. The vaccine drastically reduces your chances of becoming seriously ill, but it doesn&rsquo;t totally prevent infection.</p><p class="p4">So keep washing those hands, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://testthepeople.org">test strategically</a>, wear a mask, and watch for symptoms. And remember: even though the vaccine doesn&rsquo;t confer complete immunity, you are far better off confronting the virus and the world once you&rsquo;ve been fully vaccinated.</p><h3 class="h3">So what <em>can</em> we do?</h3><p class="p4">As per the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">CDC&rsquo;s most recent suggestions</a>, as long as you don&rsquo;t <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200624100047.htm">show symptoms</a>, fully vaccinated people can:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">Gather with other fully vaccinated people indoors and maskless without physical distancing</p></li><li><p class="p4">Avoid having to quarantine or be tested after exposure to the virus</p></li><li><p class="p4">Gather with unvaccinated members of a single household without distancing or wearing a mask, if that household has a low risk of severe disease.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">Travel domestically without having to get tested before and after travel</a></p></li></ul><h3 class="h3">What not to do</h3><p class="p4">We suggest you avoid the urge to slap a <q>Just Vaxxed&rsquo;</q> sticker on your sore arm, rip off your mask, and run towards the nearest crowded dance floor.</p><p class="p4">Seriously though: getting a vaccine isn&rsquo;t a <q>get out of COVID free</q> card. It&rsquo;s more like a bulletproof vest: you might still get hit, but you&rsquo;re less likely to bite the big one in case the worst happens.</p><p class="p4">Also, we&rsquo;re still a long way off from knowing exactly how effective the vaccines are against the new mutations of the virus. For now, your safest course of action after getting vaccinated is to continue practicing prevention, while respecting the reality it will take some time for the majority of the population to be vaccinated.</p><p class="p4">Even once you&rsquo;re vaccinated, it&rsquo;s important to avoid:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">Unmasked and undistanced gathering with high-risk populations like unvaccinated elders and others with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fneed-extra-precautions%2Fgroups-at-higher-risk.html">underlying conditions that make getting COVID more serious</a></p></li><li><p class="p4">Large crowds</p></li><li><p class="p4">Gathering indoors with unvaccinated folks from multiple households</p></li></ul><p class="p4">If you&rsquo;re hosting a small cocktail party to celebrate with a fully vaccinated friend, congrats and enjoy! But if your unvaccinated neighbor shows up, it&rsquo;s probably best to mask up and take the party outdoors. Also, having vaccination parties might be uncool, considering not everyone gets access to the vaccine at the same rate—so be discreet.</p><h3 class="h3">To sum up</h3><p class="p4">Things are changing, yet again and hopefully for the better. Depending on your location and community, you may be seeing more and more people relax their vigilance and precautions. You might also be chuckling with angst about how some of them never followed those precautions in the first place—and for that, we feel you.</p><p class="p4">But we think it&rsquo;s too early to throw our hands up and <q>go back to normal</q>—and the CDC agrees. There are benefits to relaxing some of the most restrictive social distancing measures, but now is not the time to disregard them all. In public settings, vaccinated people still need to continue to follow all public health precautions.</p><p class="p4">Ultimately, it&rsquo;s a gesture of mutual respect and consideration to empathize with and protect the health of the most vulnerable in any private or public setting. We won&rsquo;t weather this pandemic through science alone, but by doing our best to be respectful, considerate, and patient under the most trying of times. Even when you&rsquo;re seeing the light at the tunnel, it&rsquo;s important to keep up the good work until everyone has made it through to the other side.</p></div>' }

      { content: '<div class="sub-section"><p class="p4">When renegade.bio held its first no-cost COVID-19 testing at San Francisco&rsquo;s Pride Is a Riot rally in Dolores Park in June 2020, our goal was to provide a resource to underserved communities in the Bay Area to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 testing for disease prevention.</p><p class="p4">Data collected from that event showed 44 percent of the people we tested never had a COVID-19 test before. We considered that a measure of success. But the majority of those tested were white and had received a COVID-19 test prior to our event. While we reached some of the communities we set out to assist, such as the LGBTQ+ community, we hadn&rsquo;t reached others, such as people of color, the unhoused and other disenfranchised populations.</p><figure class=" w-richtext-align-floatleft"><div class="image-container"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/renegade-bio/image/upload/newsroom/publications/rethinking-diagnostics-to-reduce-healthcare-disparities/covid-testing-solutions-follow-up-line.jpg" width="1600" height="848" title="r.bio Pride is a Riot testing event, San Francisco Mission, June 2020" alt="People waiting in line for COVID testing" loading="lazy" alt="People in line for COVID testing"></div><figcaption>r.bio <em>Pride is a Riot</em> testing event, San Francisco Mission, June 2020</figcaption></figure><p class="p4">This was a turning point for us. We realized we needed to identify and address not only traditional barriers to access to care for marginalized communities—such as income, socioeconomic status, access to technology and transportation—but more complex barriers such as deep-seeded mistrust, disenfranchisement and a lack of healthcare education.</p><p class="p4">In response, we reached out to the California Department of Health as well as community based organizations that are deeply embedded and trusted sources among underserved communities to better understand how we could meet the communities&rsquo; needs. This proved vital to our understanding. For example, when we learned from our partner Umoja Health that Black communities were skeptical of nasal swabs, we offered to collect test samples through saliva. Meeting the community where it was at resulted in increased trust and participation, and ultimately better health outcomes.</p><p class="p4">This approach to develop strategic community partnerships has shaped our mission as a public benefit corporation that steps beyond the function of a laboratory and travels the entire journey of access, education, testing and treatment with those we serve. It informs where we set up our collection sites and where we&rsquo;ll set up future labs as well. When we hear of communities with limited to no access to testing, we reach out, just as we did with Alameda, California, where we established our most recent COVID-19 testing site.</p><p class="p4">But everyone needs access to testing, regardless of income and socioeconomic status. Our agility and ability to quickly adapt to meet the unique needs of communities has enabled us to serve an incredibly diverse population from underserved communities to members of the United Nations who needed a time-sensitive, customized testing solution. As COVID-19 testing slows, we&rsquo;re using our experience and knowledge learned during the pandemic to expand our clinical diagnostics to multi-panel testing. Due to the pandemic, the field of clinical diagnostics—an antiquated industry—is undergoing a revolution as new methodologies make it possible to develop widely accessible, rapid, accurate, low-cost testing solutions that inform medical decision-making in a timely manner.</p><p class="p4">How do we select which tests we develop? We look at where there&rsquo;s a lack of attention—specifically among underserved communities—and how we can bridge the gap between science and healthcare education through community partnerships to empower change. We see reproductive and sexual health as one area of healthcare that urgently needs attention.</p><figure><div class="image-container"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/renegade-bio/image/upload/newsroom/publications/rethinking-diagnostics-to-reduce-healthcare-disparities/diagnostic-testing-laboratory-staff.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="Lab testing personnel in renegade.bio’s Berkeley lab" alt="Lab testing personnel operates an automated system" loading="lazy" alt="Lab testing personnel operates an automated system"></div><figcaption>lab testing personnel in renegade.bio&rsquo;s Berkeley lab</figcaption></figure><p class="p4">In the near future we plan to release our rapid, low-cost preeclampsia test and expand access through partnerships with targeted community-based organizations to reach the most diverse populations that need access to this early diagnostic test. In 2021, the Biden Administration <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/07/fact-sheet-vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-call-to-action-to-reduce-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/">announced</a> its plans to <q>address the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis as a key priority,</q> and direct $3 billion toward the effort as part of the Build Back Better Act. The administration also noted <q>rates are among the highest in the developed world, and they are especially high among Black women and Native American women, regardless of their income or education levels.</q></p><p class="p4">An in-depth understanding of the populations we serve also informs the development of our tests. We can tune the algorithms of our assays to target specific biomarkers of the population being tested, for example, Black women, to calculate the corresponding disease risk. Not only do we offer a test that can help women understand their pregnancies more completely, we&rsquo;re making it accessible the same way we brought COVID-19 testing to our community, which has the potential to impact a large segment of the U.S. population.</p><p class="p4">Additionally, we see accessible diagnostics playing a vital role in local and national healthcare initiatives by implementing early detection and preventing the spread of disease. For example, San Francisco launched <q><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gettingtozerosf.org/about_gtz-start/#:~:text=Our%20Goals,their%20current%20levels%20by%202025.">Getting to Zero</a>,</q> an initiative to eradicate new cases of HIV, have zero HIV-related deaths and zero HIV stigma in the city by 2025. According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20estimated%20number,among%20all%20other%20age%20groups.">hiv.org</a>, Black communities make up 44 percent of all new HIV cases in the U.S. and gay men make up 69 percent of all new HIV cases in the country.</p><p class="p4">Early diagnostics coupled with community outreach among underserved communities can support this initiative. We have the capacity to educate populations that have a high propensity to transmit HIV. This includes sex workers, unhoused populations, users of IV drugs and communities that traditionally do not discuss sexually transmitted diseases. Diagnostics and education helps individuals understand what it means for them and what they can do to stay safe.</p><p class="p4">It&rsquo;s our goal to make accessible testing mainstream nationwide. We believe the key to expanding that reach is through community partnerships and commitments to communities. To support that, we plan to open additional laboratories in the Midwest and the East Coast in 2023 to serve underrepresented populations that lack access to care and health education.</p><p class="p4">While the opportunities are ripe for emerging diagnostics to shape new standards of access to care, the role of state and federal government cannot be understated. As an organization, we continue to lobby for legislation that supports not only the rapid development of clinical diagnostics, but the inclusion of these tests as fundamental health care for all, as well as the funding to support them.</p></div>' }

Adding SalivaDirect as a new test option enables renegade.bio to deliver quality healthcare to additional communities, as well as schools, businesses, and individuals.</p><p class="p4"><q>Over the past 10 months, we focused our efforts and expertise on answering the urgent need for rapid and reliable COVID-19 tests, while also making them widely available and affordable</q>, said Craig Rouskey, MSc, co-founder &amp; CEO of renegade.bio. <q>SalivaDirect is a less invasive, easier-to-use test that not only streamlines the collection process and reduces costs, but also presents a testing format that more people can access. By delivering expedited results, we can help educate people about their positive status to reduce the spread of the virus.</q></p><p class="p4">To date, renegade.bio has partnered with large organizations that are responsible for keeping people safe within their work environments. The company has run COVID-19 testing programs for the NBA, San Francisco Giants and the United Nations. <q>Our ability to conduct SalivaDirect testing gives us the opportunity to partner with additional workplaces, educational institutions and businesses to keep students and employees safe and maintain healthy operations during the pandemic</q>, said Rouskey. <q>K-12 schools, colleges,universities, and higher learning institutions are particularly ideal partners for us.</q></p><p class="p4">The company&rsquo;s partnership with Primary Bio gives people the ability to register, schedule, and check in once at the test site. People taking the SalivaDirect test will scan the code on their tube and use a biodegradable straw to collect their own saliva under medical supervision. The tests are then dropped off at one of renegade.bio&rsquo;s labs located in Oakland, CA or NYC, NY.</p><p class="p4">Expedited results are delivered directly to testers through the Primary Bio portal and results can be accessed online using a unique code that is sent via text. If a tester does not have internet access a phone call can be made to the company for help with accessing their results.</p><p class="p4">From corporate testing programs, to pop-up mobile events and on-site clinics, renegade.bio&rsquo;s commitment as a public benefit corporation has fueled the company to help as many people as possible. <q>We are excited to be able to offer SalivaDirect to the communities we serve and this represents an evolution in renegade.bio&rsquo;s commitment to doing everything we can to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2</q>, said Rouskey.</p><h4 class="h4">About renegade.bio</h4><p class="p4">As a public benefit corporation, renegade.bio is accelerating humanity&rsquo;s capacity to test for novel pathogens such as COVID-19. The company empowers an overburdened public health system to respond swiftly to epidemiologic crises by delivering fast, reliable, cost-effective solutions for community-based triage. In collaboration with other laboratories, researchers, and organizations across the ecosystem of public health, renegade.bio is working day and night with a singular goal to make COVID-19 testing accessible to everyone regardless of income. renegade.bio holds a LGBT-Owned Business Enterprise Certification from the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce.
